Team Lift Sprint is an online shopping site that sell a manner of goods related to sport and/or sporting equipment. It is designed for Strength & Conditioning coaches, team managers, players and those focusing on getting the best out of their performance. The website provides status and feedback to users at all stages of the shopping process, as well as items on sale and correct UX design. Coming from a sporting background myself, the site itself comprises a number of categories which are discussed in detail below with the aim that Team Lift Sprint be a "one stop shop" for all those either training individually or in a group.

The site has been tested on a number of devices including desktop, tablets and mobile - as shown in the testing readme file. The site is also designed to handle the full suite of user management, as defined in the Information architecture of this ReadMe file.
