### Code validation
The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator, JSHint JavaScript Validator Services and PEP8 online were used to validate the project to ensure there were no errors in the project. 

##### W3C CSS Validator

See the below screenshot for W3C CSS validation, with no errors present:

![image](media/readme/css-validator.JPG)

##### W3C Markup Validator

In using the W3C markup validator, a number of non-fixable errors were present through the validation process. See below explanations for error explanation.

1) Header error

The head element is deemed to be missing the child element "title". This is present on the base.html page, however this error results where base.html is extended and as such the validator has not picked it up. No further edits required.

![image](media/readme/head-error.JPG)

2) Spacing error

W3C noted that there are non-space characters inside a table. This is present on any templated language "for" loops, whereby a html tag is not present on either side of these statements. No further edits required due to python language used in HTML templates.

![image](media/readme/spacing-error.JPG)

3) URL error

This refers to the use of "{}" url references throughout the HTML pages. These braces are used for site references and again, due to django language site navigation. No edits required.

![image](media/readme/url-error.JPG)

4) Sort error

The below three errors are present on the HTML pages where the sort function is used. Python language "if" statement is present on the user interactive sort statement and possible through the use of python logic. No edits necessary.

![image](media/readme/sort-error.JPG)

As above explanations, these are not true errors but due to the templating language present in Django/Python language. HTML validation showed no further errors and as such this project has passed this testing protocol.

##### JSHint JavaScript Validator Services

As per #8 on the Fixes section at the bottom of the file, only colon errors were present on the JSHint validation which were promptly fixed.
See below screenshots for results on JSHint validation on seperate JS code (3) - no errors present after the above was completed:

![image](media/readme/stripe-js-checker.JPG)

##### PEP8 online

As per project guidelines, the entire site was tested for PEP8 compliance using the python3 -m flake8 command in the completed project terminal. Unresolved errors and documentation as to why they are not updated in line with PEP8 are detailed below. Overall, PEP8 style guidelines adhered to for this project and fixes where noted by the terminal and above commnd were applied.

Area | Error | Rationale of not fixing
---- | ----- | -----------------------
1 | A number of vscode errors (unused imports, over/under indentation, line too long) | I did not use the vscode files in my project at all and these have been autogenerated. No fix necessary 
2 | Migration errors (line too long) | As these are migrations and the relevent model PEP8 errors were rectified, no update necessary 
3 | Unused TestCase imports | Whilst I could have deleted these and despite the project brief changing during my build, I will leave these in as I plan to use automated tests once I finish my course and understand this aspect 
4 | Variable "e" assigned but never used | Incorrect assessment by PEP8, these are assigned in the webhooks and no fix necessary
5 | Avoid using "X" on "X" based fields in model files | Design choice, no fix necessary
6 | Certain django automated imports unused | Could remove but leaving in should I take my project further once my course is completed
7 | settings.py AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS line length error | Cannot change due to structure of list - no fix necessary

### Accessibility/Lighthouse testing

[WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used on all pages to review site accessibility. No errors on the site occurred as a result of this accessibility testing. The only updates related to this was updating aria labels on the navbar search and quantity buttons in the quantity form - detailed in #3 and #9 in the fixes section respectively at the bottom of this testing.md file.

See below for results on various pages:

* Home Page

* Products Page

* Bag Page

![image](media/readme/bag-page.JPG)

* Checkout Page

![image](media/readme/checkout-page.JPG)

* Profile Page

![image](media/readme/profile-page.JPG)

[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used on all pages to review site performance across a number of metrics. Green scores were awarded on the site across all lighthouse metrics as a result of this performance testing.

See below for results on various pages:

* Home Page

### Responsive testing

The site adheres to the Bootstrap grid layout and breakpoints. Additional media queries have been used to align many aspects of the site. The media breakpoints have been noted in the README.md file. Additionality, [Google's mobile test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) has been used for mobile functionality, with the result of "Page is mobile friendly" achieved as per below:

![image](media/readme/google-mobile-test.JPG)

Virtual devices have consisted of testing on the following screen types on Google Chrome:

Widths used to test the below are:
* 1400px - desktop
* 768px - ipad
* 320px - iPhone 5SE

#### Known Bugs

The following respresent bugs in the project:

1. The Product addition/subtraction button on the bag page - it does not stack correctly on unfamiliar device layout. To fix, I could easily have removed the text narrative from the buttons/resized for the below pixels, however I feel they are pertinant so the user knows what to do. This bug only occurs between 585px and 576px - no known device width occurs as per my responsiveness testing and as such I will not fix this bug.

See below for what it should look like:

![image](media/readme/review-bug1.JPG)

And bug as per 585px-576px width:

2. A rare "gutter" layout error sometimes occurs on the heroku app with regards to mobile layout on the home screen and the product review form. It is always fixed when I refreshed the page as shown below - not a real bug as it just relates to refresh. As I explained, this only happens extremely rarely however I would be interested to find the cause.

See below for what it should look like:

And pre-refresh:

3. As per manual tests, if I add a product with no image the "noimage.png" does not appear. Whilst this worked in production, when I brought all my images to my AWS bucket I could not add it. I contacted AWS support regarding this and after a lengthy call I would have to re-register my account and repeat the AWS process noted in the deployment section of the ReadMe file. This also affects my favicon icon for the site. I decided not to do this and as such this is a known bug.
