            <h3><b>Why have product prices increased?</b></h3>
            <p>Unfortunately due to Brexit, any UK based equipment has incurred a delivery levy on import. As such, this must be passed down to the final customer.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3><b>I wish to change my order, how can I?</b></h3>
            <p>No issue at all, please call our service contact number at your earliest convenience and have your order number ready!</p>
            <hr>
            <h3><b>Do you have a guarantee on all equipment sold?</b></h3>
            <p>We do indeed. All equipment comes with a 1 year warranty for items under â‚¬100, and a two year warranty for items above this.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3><b>How often do you update the stock on the website?</b></h3>
            <p>Stock is updated as received, however if you require a piece of equipment currently not on our site please get in touch and we'll try to arrange from one of our suppliers.</p>
